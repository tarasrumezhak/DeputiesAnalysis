Ukrainian Deputies Utility Factor
It is proposed to collect the information about Ukrainian deputies using data.rada.gov.ua API to analyze their activity. This service provides a lot of kinds of different information, such as names of all deputies, their parties, biographical information, and their votes. 
The main point of this research project is not to build the statistical information about the general information provided in the basic description, but deeply analyze the activity of the government members. The most important information in this project is the financial spends on each deputy, the count of his bills, which laws does he/she support etc. The Utility factor oh everyone will be built after analyzing the information.
